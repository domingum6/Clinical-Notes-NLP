Actually, the main reasons we are seeing her back so soon which are elevated blood pressure and her right arm symptoms are basically resolved.  Blood pressure is better even though she is not currently on the higher dose Mavik likely recommended.  She apparently did not feel well with the higher dose, so she just went back to her previous dose of 1 mg daily.  She thinks, she also has an element of office hypertension.  Also, since she is on Mavik plus verapamil, she could switch over to the combined drug Tarka.  However, when we gave her samples of that she thought they were too big for her to swallow.  Basically, she is just back on her previous blood pressure regimen.  However, her blood pressure seems to be better today.  Her daughter says that they do check it periodically and it is similar to todays reading.  Her right arm symptoms are basically resolved and she attributed that to her muscle problem back in the right shoulder blade.  We did do a C-spine and right shoulder x-ray and those just mainly showed some degenerative changes and possibly some rotator cuff injury with the humeral head quite high up in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but this does not seem to cause her any problems.  She has some vague stomach problems, although apparently it is improved when she stopped Aleve and she does not have any more aches or pains off Aleve.  She takes Tylenol p.r.n., which seems to be enough for her.  She does not think she has any acid reflux symptoms or heartburn.  She does take Tums t.i.d. and also Mylanta at night.  She has had dentures for many, many years and just recently I guess in the last few months, although she was somewhat vague on this, she has had some sores in her mouth.  They do heal up, but then she will get another one.  She also thinks since she has been on the Lexapro, she has somewhat of a tremor of her basically whole body at least upper body including the torso and arms and had all of the daughters who I not noticed to speak of and it is certainly difficult to tell her today that she has much tremor.

        "spaCy’s named entity recognition (NER), especially with SciSpaCy models, is valuable for identifying medical terms like diseases and symptoms from clinical notes. It works quickly and integrates well with other Python tools, making it efficient for large datasets. However, its accuracy is limited by the model used—smaller models like en_core_sci_sm may miss complex or rare terms, while larger models require more resources. Also, spaCy NER does not classify entities as present or absent, so additional logic or models are needed for contextual interpretation."

        "Using Ollama with LangChain and an LLM like LLaMA3 provides flexible and context-aware extraction of medical information from clinical text. Unlike rule-based tools or traditional NER, the LLM can understand nuanced language and infer whether a symptom or disease is present or absent, even when it's implied rather than explicitly stated. This makes it particularly powerful for subjective clinical narratives. However, its utility depends on a reliable local setup—running Ollama requires sufficient compute and correct networking. Additionally, LLMs may hallucinate or misclassify without proper prompt tuning and evaluation."

        "The model demonstrated strong performance in identifying and classifying diseases and symptoms from the subjective section of clinical notes. With a precision of 1.00, it accurately predicted all conditions labeled as PRESENT without any false positives, indicating high reliability when it does make a prediction. The recall of 0.91 shows that it successfully identified the majority of relevant conditions, missing only a small portion of those that were actually PRESENT in the ground truth annotations. This balance between precision and recall is reflected in the high F1 score of 0.95, suggesting the model is both accurate and consistent. Overall, these results indicate that the model is effective for extracting and classifying clinical conditions, with room for minor improvements in recall to capture all relevant entities."
